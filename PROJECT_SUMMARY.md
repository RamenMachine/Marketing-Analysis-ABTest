# Marketing A/B Test Evaluation Platform - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

A comprehensive, production-ready platform for analyzing marketing campaign effectiveness through rigorous statistical A/B testing methodology. This project demonstrates expertise in data science, statistical analysis, full-stack development, and business intelligence.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Marketing teams need reliable, statistically rigorous methods to evaluate campaign effectiveness. Traditional approaches often lack:
- Multiple statistical perspectives (frequentist vs Bayesian)
- Business impact translation
- Interactive visualization
- Real-time confidence level adjustment

## ✅ Solution

Built a full-stack platform combining:
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Both frequentist and Bayesian methods
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualizations with adjustable parameters
- **Business Intelligence**: ROAS, ROI, CPA, and scaling projections
- **Professional Documentation**: Jupyter notebooks with mathematical explanations

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Glassmorphism UI design for professional appearance
- Recharts for interactive data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend/Analysis (Python)
- Comprehensive statistical analysis using SciPy and Statsmodels
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed mathematical explanations
- Data processing with Pandas and NumPy
- Professional visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn

### Key Features
1. **Dual Statistical Approaches**: Frequentist (t-test, chi-square) and Bayesian (Beta-Binomial)
2. **Dynamic Confidence Intervals**: Adjustable 90%, 95%, 99% levels
3. **Business Metrics**: ROAS, ROI, CPA, break-even analysis
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Temporal patterns, dose-response relationships
5. **Export Functionality**: JSON export for further analysis
